# phishing-simulation
A project to design and execute a phishing simulation to educate users on recognizing phishing attempts.
It analyzes user responses and provides feedback to improve awareness and prevent real-world attacks.

Features:

Phishing Email Campaign: Created realistic phishing emails that mimicked common tactics used by cybercriminals.
User Education: Provided training materials and resources to help users identify phishing attempts.
Response Analysis: Collected and analyzed user responses to the simulated phishing emails.
Feedback and Improvement: Offered personalized feedback and recommendations to enhance user awareness and prevent future attacks.

Process:
Planning:
Identified the target audience for the phishing simulation.
Developed a variety of phishing email templates based on common phishing tactics (e.g., spoofed email addresses, urgent requests for information, fake links).

Execution:
Sent phishing emails to the target audience in a controlled and ethical manner.
Monitored email interactions to track which users opened the emails, clicked on links, or provided sensitive information.

Analysis:
Analyzed the data collected from the phishing simulation.
Identified patterns in user behavior and common indicators of susceptibility.

Feedback and Training:
Provided individual feedback to users who fell for the simulated phishing attempts.
Offered group training sessions and resources to improve overall awareness.
Shared best practices for recognizing and reporting phishing attempts.

Results:
Initial Findings: A certain percentage of users fell for the phishing simulation, highlighting areas for improvement in awareness.
User Improvement: After receiving feedback and training, there was a notable decrease in the number of users who fell for subsequent phishing simulations.
Enhanced Security Posture: Overall, the organization saw an improvement in its security posture as users became more adept at identifying and avoiding phishing attempts.

Conclusion:
The phishing simulation project successfully educated users on recognizing phishing attempts and improved their ability to prevent real-world attacks. Ongoing simulations and training are recommended to maintain and further enhance user awareness.
